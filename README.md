# TUTORIAL

Just a sample app I'm using to learn about turbo on rails.

The initial commit has everything working for all the css stuff before any turbo things are added.

1.  Needed to run yarn add scss
2.  Added the following line to config/manifest.js
//= link application.css


Installed nodejs16 (sudo port install nodejs16)

Created this project with:
rails new quote-editor --css=sass --javascript=esbuild --database=sqlite3

Trying to use the bin/setup and bin/dev commands to start, instead of just manually running the server.

I'll note the exact instructions for starting a new project later, but the initial commit here is working fine.
